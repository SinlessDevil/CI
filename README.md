## üîÄ Supported Versions

### üîπ v1.0.0 ‚Äî game-ci (Unity Personal License)

Uses [game-ci/unity-builder@v4](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-builder). Works with Unity Personal.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Import `ci-github-action-v1.0.0.unitypackage` into your project.
2. Configure `Assets/Plugins/CI/CIConfig.asset`.
3. Ensure you have the following GitHub secrets:

| Secret Name      | Description                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `UNITY_EMAIL`    | Unity account email              |
| `UNITY_PASSWORD` | Unity account password           |
| `UNITY_LICENSE`  | Content of base64 `.ulf` license |

**How to get your Unity license file:**

1. Open Unity Hub on your local machine.
2. Go to `Preferences ‚Üí Licenses ‚Üí Manual Activation`.
3. Follow the instructions and locate the `.ulf` file after activation:

   * Windows: `C:\ProgramData\Unity\Unity_lic.ulf`
   * macOS: `/Library/Application Support/Unity/Unity_lic.ulf`
4. Open the file in a text editor and copy its full content.
5. Add it as `UNITY_LICENSE` in your GitHub repository secrets.

> ‚úÖ Recommended Runner: [game-ci/unity-builder@v4](https://github.com/game-ci/unity-builder)
> It automatically installs Unity and triggers your CLI method.

### üîπ v2.0.0 ‚Äî Custom Docker Image (Unity Pro License Only)

Uses your own Docker image with pre-installed Unity Editor.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Import `ci-github-action-v2.0.0.unitypackage` into the project.
2. Configure `CIConfig.asset` as usual.
3. Use this container section in your `yml` file:

```yaml
container:
  image: ghcr.io/sinlessdevil/unity-ci-image:2023.2.1f1
  credentials:
    username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
    password: ${{ secrets.CR_PAT }}
```

4. Manually activate Unity Pro license inside Docker.
5. Unity Personal **WILL NOT WORK** in headless CI ‚Äî it requires a display.

| Secret Name      | Description                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `USERNAME`       | GitHub username (for Docker registry access) |
| `CR_PAT`         | GitHub personal access token                 |
| `UNITY_EMAIL`    | Optional, for in-container activation        |
| `UNITY_PASSWORD` | Optional, for in-container activation        |

## üß™ Notes on `build.cake`

* This file **does not build Unity itself**.
* Your method should be triggered via `Plugins.CI.Editor.Builder.*`
* The script is responsible for:

  * Parsing logs
  * Setting app version
  * Tracking Git SHA / commits
  * Optional test/log analysis

---

## üîÅ CI Triggers

* Automatically runs when commit message contains `#build`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Gotchas

* Unity Personal builds will **fail** inside Docker without GUI (headless limitation).
* If using a custom Docker image, you **must activate Unity Pro license** manually inside it.
* Unity activation can silently fail; always check `/root/activation.log`.
* Make sure secrets are properly set, especially for Docker image access (`USERNAME`, `CR_PAT`).
* GitHub caches Library folder by default for faster builds, but cache invalidation logic depends on hashing `Assets`, `Packages`, `ProjectSettings`.
